SIGN project

It uses **Flask/Flask-Restplus** for the server and **SQLAlchemy** as ORM with it GIS extension **GeoAlchemy2**.

## Quick start

First you need to create a config file `local_settings.py` in the project root folder as follow:

```python
DEBUG=False # True for debug
DATABASE_URI='dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database'
# Uncomment the line bellow to fix an application key (eg. uuid)
# SECRET_KEY='secret_app_key'
```

For production you can add environment variables instead of the file (same config name with 'API\_' prefix):

-   API_DEBUG
-   API_SECRET_KEY
-   API_DATABASE_URI

If you do not specify an application secret key, a random key is used when the server starts.

You must install the required dependencies with `pip install -r Requirements.txt` (we recommend using a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)).

You can now start playing with the API by starting it with `python manage.py runserver` and going to <http://127.0.0.1:5000/v1/>

## How to use

To interact with the project, you need to use the manager (`python manage.py`). The main commands are listed bellow but it can be outdated, we recommend to read the help from the command.
