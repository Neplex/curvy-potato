SIGN project

It uses **Flask/Flask-Restplus** for the server and **SQLAlchemy** as ORM with it GIS extension **GeoAlchemy2**.

## Quick start

First you need to create an environment file `.env` in the project root folder as follow:

```bash
DEBUG=False # True for debug
DATABASE_URL='dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database'
# Uncomment the line bellow to fix an application key (eg. uuid)
# SECRET_KEY='secret_app_key'
```

If you do not specify an application secret key, a random key is used when the server starts.

You must install the required dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (we recommend using a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)).

You can now start playing with the API by starting it with `flask run` and going to <http://127.0.0.1:5000/v1/>

## How to use

To interact with the project, you need to use the command line interface (`flask`). The main commands are listed bellow but it can be outdated, we recommend to read the help from the command.
